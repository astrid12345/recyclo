    "*   \"categories\":  List of the different categories this dataset uses\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conversion\n",
    "To convert the TACO dataset to a format YOLOv8 can use, we must:\n",
    "* Split the TACO images into train and val sets\n",
    "* Extract label and bbox info from annotations.json, and save it in individual txt files corresponding to the image files\n",
